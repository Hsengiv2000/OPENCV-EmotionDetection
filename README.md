This is a project done for a Design module 3.007 Introduction to Design. The product intended was a SMART TEDDY BEAR- SUTEDDY that uses computer vision to detect a person's emotion (ideally 3-5 years old) and reply accordingly. So the code had to be written as to run well on an RPi(microprocessor). OpenCv was the preferred vision library. Haar Cascades was used to detect the faces while TensorFlow was used in training dataset scraped online into 4 emotions: Happy, Sad, Neutral, Angry. The bear then replies aplty "Oh, turn that frown upside down" "It is a bright and cheerful day" etc. Contact for training images (loosely based on CK dataset)
